This is the companion software of the article "A linear algorithm for the minimal realization problem in physical
coordinates with a non-invertible output matrix" by C.Faccio and F.Marcuzzi

The software is a work-in-progress and "as is", i.e. not intended for any use different from mere understading of the presented method.
